#### A reimagining of OS X's `yes`

Ever used the program `yes` on OS X? Perhaps it's on Linux or a BSD as well. If you've used it, I'm sure you know how invaluable `yes` is to your workflow. Whether you're piping it to `rm -rf *`, or you just have a very specifically broken keyboard, `yes` is the right tool for almost any job.

However, the original `yes` program, brilliant as it may well be, is sorely lacking in two features. In this Git repository, you'll find my humble extensions:

## no

A program that does the opposite of `yes`: it sends a stream of n's to stdout. Planning on adding Facebook connectivity in the not-too-distant future.

## sometimes

Prints random characters. Some will be `y`. Some will be `n`. Which will come out first?!!? It's like Russian Roulette! Perfect for all you thrillseekers.

#### sometimes is not done yet because I don't know how to do random numbers in C
